# BiBTeXML

Intended to eventually replace an existing part of LaTeXML, BiBTeXML is a WIP software that is intended to

* read BibTeX bibliographies
* interpret BiBTeX style files
* output a machine-readble style file that maintains meta information about each string and source for it

Dependencies:
* `Test::More`
* `File::Basename`
* `File::Spec`
